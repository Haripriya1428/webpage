<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p>Not only does he possess an intelligence that makes physicists at MIT feel like they’re back in grade school, Tony Stark has the charm, confidence, and charisma to make fellow superheroes follow his lead and villains wish they never landed on the wrong side of “neutral evil.”

    That said, Tony Stark is alluring not just because he possesses admirable qualities, but also because he possesses less-than-stellar qualities that make him seem fully human. In fact, one could argue that it’s precisely Tony’s complexity, like the drinking problem that landed on the strongest Marvel villains list, that gives Iron Man his enduring legacy.
    
    Tony’s complexity manifests in the following ways:2
    
    He’s warm yet closed off – While deep-down Tony cares tremendously for the plight of the Avengers and humanity at large, he has an odd way of showing it (did Tony really have to kick the Hulk off of Earth?). His personality mostly stems from his privileged upbringing and the lack of a relationship with his father.
    
    He’s compassionate yet arrogant – Tony’s arrogance is on display from the moment we first meet him. After all, who rides around in a humvee in Afghanistan, sipping whisky while the world is falling apart around them? Although he can be arrogant, he’s also known for his compassionate side—especially towards Peter Parker.
    
    He’s ultra-intelligent yet insecure – We’ve already made a Thor-sized deal about Tony’s intellect, so we’re not going to inflate his ego further. Instead, let’s talk about his equally-large level of insecurity. Due to his upbringing, Tony often has difficulty trusting and loving others, including himself. As a result, he occasionally falls victim to his vices.
    
    Tony’s complexity is the reason why he resonates with us and why we have so much love for the high-tech (and high-maintenance) superhero. If you love Tony’s swagger as much as we do, celebrate your fandom with a Marvel Avengers Collectors Box that comes with an Iron Man LED light and other official Marvel Avengers accessories.</p>

<h3> Captain America</h3>
<p>Captain America is a superhero created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby who appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1, published on December 20, 1940 by Timely Comics, a corporate predecessor to Marvel. Captain America's civilian identity is Steve Rogers, a frail man enhanced to the peak of human physical perfection by an experimental "super-soldier serum" after joining the United States Army to aid the country's efforts in World War II. Equipped with an American flag-inspired costume and a virtually indestructible shield, Captain America and his sidekick Bucky Barnes clashed frequently with the villainous Red Skull and other members of the Axis powers. In the final days of the war, an accident left Captain America frozen in a state of suspended animation until he was revived in modern times. He resumes his exploits as a costumed hero and becomes leader of the superhero team the Avengers, but frequently struggles as a "man out of time" to adjust to the new era.

    The character quickly emerged as Timely's most popular and commercially successful wartime creation upon his original publication, though the popularity of superheroes declined towards the end of the war and into the post-war period, and Captain America Comics was discontinued in 1950. The character saw a short-lived revival in 1953 before returning to comics in 1964, and has since remained in continuous publication. Captain America's creation as an explicitly anti-Nazi figure was a consciously political undertaking: Simon and Kirby were stridently opposed to the actions of Nazi Germany and supporters of U.S. </p>

<h3>  Thor</h3>
<p>If you find yourself pining over the mighty Thor, you’re in good company. We, too, find the brawny God of Thunder mesmerizing. From the physical strength that almost landed him the top spot of strongest Marvel heroes, to his love-hate relationship with his adopted brother Loki, there’s something about Thor that hits harder than Mjølnir.

    Thor is the quintessential super hero. He’s strong and fearless, radiating positive energy that screams, “Oh, yeah, bad guy? Come and take it!” He’s also quite funny—especially when he first arrives on Earth as clueless as an Asgardian fish out of water. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that Thor is played by Ur-Man Chris Hemsworth. With his long locks and sensitive machismo, Hemsworth could make pouring coffee look cool.
    
    There are so many moments in Thor’s character arc that make him a favorite in our books:
    
    His obliviousness when it comes to social cues
    His Dad-Bod videogame nerd phase</p>

<h3>Hulk</h3>
<p>The Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of The Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character, who has dissociative identity disorder (DID), is primarily represented by the alter ego Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a limitless degree of physical strength, and the alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, both of whom typically resent each other.

    Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving the life of Rick Jones during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will. This transformation often leads to destructive rampages and to conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger.</p>
